    //SnapshotFactory //Implements factory to instantiate snapshots
    snapshot-factory.mo
Purpose: Encapsulates the logic for creating snapshot instances of the game state.
Contents:
A SnapshotFactory class with a method like createSnapshot that takes the current state and returns a new snapshot instance.
Potentially multiple factory methods if different types of snapshots are needed for various aspects of the game.
