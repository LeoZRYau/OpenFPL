# OpenFPL Design Patterns



This document outlines the design patterns chosen for the development of a fantasy football application on the Internet Computer blockchain. The selected patterns aim to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system, ensuring efficient data management, dynamic behavior adaptation, and user interaction responsiveness.



## Memento Pattern for Team Snapshots

- **Purpose**: To capture and store the state of fantasy football teams at specific points in time.
- **Reasoning**: Allows reconstruction of a teamâ€™s state at any given week, facilitating historical data analysis and maintaining integrity of past data.

## Composite Pattern for Team and Player Management

- **Purpose**: To manage teams and players in a unified manner, allowing operations to be applied uniformly.
- **Reasoning**: Simplifies the management of teams and players, especially useful for operations like point calculation and team composition adjustments.

## Strategy Pattern for Season Management and Validation Rules

- **Purpose**: To define a family of algorithms (seasonal rules and validation strategies) and make them interchangeable.
- **Reasoning**: Provides flexibility in managing varying season-specific rules and team validation criteria, enhancing the adaptability of the application.

## Observer Pattern for Real-Time Updates

- **Purpose**: To update different components of the system (like leaderboards and team management interfaces) in real-time.
- **Reasoning**: Ensures that changes in team scores or player statuses are promptly reflected across the application, improving user experience and data accuracy.

## Factory Method Pattern for Snapshot Creation

- **Purpose**: To encapsulate the complexity of creating snapshots of team states.
- **Reasoning**: Abstracts the snapshot creation process, ensuring that it is decoupled from other application logic and can be modified independently.

## Singleton Pattern for Main Canister Management

- **Purpose**: To manage the main canister in the blockchain environment, ensuring a single point of control and coordination.
- **Reasoning**: Facilitates efficient resource management, consistent state maintenance, and centralized control in the decentralized blockchain context.
