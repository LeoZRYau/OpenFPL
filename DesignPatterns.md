# OpenFPL Design Patterns

This document details the design patterns utilised in the development of the OpenFPL fantasy football application on the Internet Computer blockchain. These patterns are selected to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and maintainable, focusing on efficient data management, dynamic adaptation, and enhanced user interaction.

## Memento Pattern for Team Snapshots (Integrated with Season Management)

- **Purpose**: To capture and store the state of fantasy football teams at specific times, aligning with the season's progression.
- **Integration**: Embedded within the Season Manager to streamline snapshot creation with season events.
- **Reasoning**: Enhances cohesion and simplifies the process, ensuring that snapshots are directly linked to and triggered by key moments in the season.

## Composite Pattern for Team and Player Management

- **Purpose**: To manage teams and players in a unified manner, allowing operations to be applied uniformly.
- **Reasoning**: Simplifies the management of teams and players, especially useful for operations like point calculation and team composition adjustments.

## Strategy Pattern for Season Management and Validation Rules

- **Purpose**: To define a family of algorithms (seasonal rules and validation strategies) and make them interchangeable.
- **Reasoning**: Provides flexibility in managing varying season-specific rules and team validation criteria, enhancing the adaptability of the application.

## Observer Pattern for Real-Time Season Updates

- **Purpose**: To ensure prompt updates across system components like leaderboards and team management interfaces.
- **Reasoning**: Vital for reflecting changes in team scores or player statuses in real-time, improving user experience and data accuracy.

## Observer Pattern for Real-Time Governance Updates

- **Purpose**: To handle updates in the application's data (such as player values or club details) triggered by external governance decisions.
- **Reasoning**: This integration is crucial for ensuring that the application reflects governance-driven changes accurately and promptly across all relevant components, such as player statistics, team configurations, and administrative settings, thereby maintaining data consistency and a seamless user experience.


## Factory Method Pattern within Season Management for Snapshot Creation

- **Purpose**: To encapsulate the complexity of creating snapshots of team states within the Season Manager.
- **Reasoning**: By integrating it into the Season Manager, this pattern helps abstract the snapshot creation process, naturally fitting within the season's flow.

## Singleton Pattern for Main Canister Management

- **Purpose**: To act as the central coordinator and the primary interface for the application, especially for managing timers and events, triggering actions across components like the Season Manager.
- **Reasoning**: Enables the Singleton to effectively manage and coordinate the apps scheduled events and interactions.


## Summary


In the OpenFPL fantasy football application, a series of carefully chosen design patterns are implemented to enhance the robustness, scalability, and maintainability of the system. These patterns are integral to managing data efficiently, adapting dynamically to the evolving needs of the platform, and ensuring an engaging user experience.

The Memento Pattern is seamlessly integrated within the Season Manager for capturing crucial team states, enhancing data integrity and historical tracking.
The Composite Pattern simplifies the complex task of managing teams and players, allowing for uniform operations and adjustments.
The Strategy Pattern provides flexibility in managing season-specific rules and team validation, adapting to different game scenarios.
The Observer Pattern is crucial for real-time updates, both for season changes and external governance decisions, ensuring prompt and accurate reflection of updates across the application.
The Factory Method Pattern within the Season Manager streamlines the snapshot creation process, fitting naturally within the season's progression.
The Singleton Pattern for Main Canister Management centralizes control and coordination, effectively managing timers, events, and interactions across the application.
These design patterns collectively ensure that OpenFPL not only meets its functional requirements but also remains adaptable and robust, particularly within the blockchain environment.
